Main goal:  Build and Run MCP Servers Easily and Securely with Docker 
- can we build together an app that uses call ai agent to do something through mcp? 
- i do not have any idea right now what kind of project would be nice but i am thinking 
- of something RAG-like where i have an app, a document-base bank where i can put in some pdfs 
- and a query to the agent will first retrieve info from the document bank before responding 
- with appropriate info. also something that i can demonstrate to emplpoyers that might be interested 
- with individuals witk agentic ai skills. 
- as you know y research, "SLM-first agentic ai systems" is my phd dissertation where I am working agentic ai 
- systems for data science--like automatic feature engineering like CAAFE(context aware automatic feature 
- engineering) but purely basing on slms. 
- so i would want that to kinda increase my portfolio; if you want, checking https://isaackobby.com you 
- could have fair idea of my research projects. 
- also, my laptop cannot run heavy softwares like docker, or agent inference gpu but i have google colab pro 
- with high ram a100 where i could leverage if it becomes critical. i could connect to github and access codes etc 
- from there.
